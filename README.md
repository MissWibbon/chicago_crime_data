# Chicago Crime Data

For this project, our group decided to focus on Chicago crimes.  We downloaded the [Chicago crime data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2) from 2001 to 2020 as a csv and did the same for [Rockford](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/city-of-rockford-crime-offenses-2016-ytd) from 2011-2016 to have some comparative data.

### Data Cleaning -  
- Used Python pandas to read in csv, group together similar crimes, drop null values, and change data types

### Visualizations -  
- Heat maps that showed where the most dangerous crimes occurred  
- Pie charts and bar charts depicting the types of crimes committed each year  
- Scatter plots with a linear regression predicting the trend of number of crimes by month  
- Time series showing the number of crimes per year
